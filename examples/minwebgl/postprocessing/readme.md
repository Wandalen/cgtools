# Post-Processing

**Keywords:** Post-Processing, Color Grading

This demo illustrates a post-processing pipeline in WebGL2.
It showcases how full-screen effects can be applied to a rendered 3D scene to
significantly enhance its visual quality.
The example demonstrates a chain of effects, including Bloom, ACES Tone Mapping
for handling High Dynamic Range (HDR)
lighting, and detailed Color Grading.
