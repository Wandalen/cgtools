# Spinning Cube (Size Optimized)

**Keywords:** Optimization, Binary Size, WebGL2, Basic

This demo is a size-optimized version of a spinning cube in WebGL2. It demonstrates minimal code and aggressive optimization for the smallest possible WASM binary.

This example serves as a benchmark for measuring optimization effectiveness and as a template for size-critical applications.
