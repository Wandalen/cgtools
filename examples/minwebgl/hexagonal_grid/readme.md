# Hexagonal grid example

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **hexagonal grid system** using WebGL for rendering. It is inspired by the concepts from [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) and showcases how to create, render, and manipulate hexagonal grids in a graphical environment.

---

## Features

- **Grid Layouts**: Supports various hexagonal grid layouts (pointy-topped, flat-topped).
- **Rendering**: Uses WebGL shaders (`main.vert` and `main.frag`) for efficient rendering of hexagonal grids.
- **Interactive Patterns**: Demonstrates different patterns and layouts within the hexagonal grid.
- **Coordinate Systems**: Implements axial and cube coordinate systems for grid manipulation.
- **Mesh Generation**: Generates hexagonal meshes dynamically.

## How to Run

Make sure you have installed all the necessary [dependencies](../../../module/min/minwebgl/readme.md)
In order to run the example navigate to example's directory and run next command:

``` bash
trunk serve
```

## How it is useful

This hexagonal grid demo is useful for game development, data visualization, and educational purposes.
It provides a foundation for creating hex-based maps, visualizing spatial data, and learning about hexagonal grid systems.
