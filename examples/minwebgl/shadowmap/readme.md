# Shadow Mapping

**Keywords:** Shadow Mapping, Soft Shadows, Spot Light, WebGL2, PBR, Lightmaps

This demo demonstrates real-time shadow mapping implementation with soft shadow baking in WebGL2. The example showcases a complete shadow pipeline including shadow map generation, soft shadow calculation, and integration with PBR materials.

Shadow mapping is a fundamental technique in real-time 3D graphics for creating realistic shadows. This implementation features a spot light casting soft shadows on a scene with glTF models, combining traditional shadow maps with lightmap baking for enhanced visual quality.
