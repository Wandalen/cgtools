## 1. Project Goal

Create a high-performance Rust crate (`line_tools`) that provides comprehensive tools for rendering lines.

## 2. Problem Solved
`line_tools` provides a single, robust library for rendering lines built on proven architectural patterns from the wTools ecosystem.

## 3. Ubiquitous Language

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Line** | A list of points that make up a line |
| **Join** | The geometry type to join to straight line segments together |
| **Cap** | The geometry type to cover the end points of the line |


## 4. Use Cases & Applications

### 4.1 Primary Use Cases

| Use Case | Complexity |
|----------|------------|
| **Data Visualization** | Customizable line thickness and style for representing data values, clean rendering for charts and graphs.|
| **Game Development**| Drawing UI elements (health bars, maps), creating visual effects (lasers, trails), debugging tools. |
| **Art and Illustration** | Smooth, customizable strokes with varying thickness, creative control over line ends and corners for artistic expression. |


### 4.3 Performance Characteristics

| Operation | O |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Add a point** | O(1) |
| **Remove a point** | O(n) | 
| **Create a mesh** | O(n) | 

## 5. Deliverables

1. **Published Rust Crate**: Compliant with workspace dependency management
2. **Source Code**: Following strict codestyle and design rulebooks  
3. **API Documentation**: Generated via `cargo doc` with complete coverage
4. **Usage Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for common use cases

## 6. Functional Requirements

- **FR-1**: Different implementations of lines should be feature seperated
- **FR-2**: 3D line should decrease in size with distance from the camera
- **FR-3**: Line should support editing of any points from the list

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: 100% documentation coverage via `cargo doc`
- **NFR-2**: All functions use noun-verb naming order
- **NFR-3**: 100% adherence to Codestyle Rulebook formatting

## 8. Dependency Architecture

### 8.1 Required wTools Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
# Core wTools ecosystem
minwebgl = { workspace = true, optional = true }
ndarray_cg = { workspace = true, optional = true }
mod_interface = { workspace = true, optional = true }
serde = { workspace = true, features = [ "derive" ], optional = true }

web-sys = { workspace = true, optional = true, features = [
  'WebGlActiveInfo',
]}

# Development and testing
test_tools = { workspace = true, optional = true }
```

### 8.2 Current Architecture (Implemented)
```

├── lib.rs  
├── d2.rs
├── d3.rs
├── caps.rs
├── joins.rs
├── helpers.rs
├── mesh.rs
├── program.rs
├── d2/
    └── line.rs
└── d3/
    └── line.rs     

```

## 9. Module Structure

Each module follows the strict mod_interface pattern:

```rust
mod private
{

}

::mod_interface::mod_interface!
{
  own use ::mod_interface::mod_interface;

  /// A layer for 2D graphics-related functionalities.
  layer d2;
  /// A layer for 3D graphics-related functionalities.
  layer d3;

  /// A layer dedicated to line join styles (e.g., miter, bevel, round).
  layer joins;
  /// A layer dedicated to line cap styles (e.g., butt, round, square).
  layer caps;

  /// A layer for mesh generation and manipulation.
  layer mesh;
  /// A layer for shader programs and related functionality.
  layer program;

  /// A layer for helper functions and utilities used by other modules.
  layer helpers;
}
```

## 10. Conformance Checklist

- ⏳ **FR-1**: Different implementations of lines should be feature seperated
- ⏳ **FR-2**: 3D line should decrease in size with distance from the camera
- ⏳ **FR-3**: Line should support editing of any points from the list

- ✅ **NFR-1**: 100% documentation coverage via `cargo doc`
- ⏳ **NFR-2**: All functions use noun-verb naming order
- ✅ **NFR-3**: 100% adherence to Codestyle Rulebook formatting

## 11. Corner cases
- ✅ **1**: Overlapping geometry when using blending - joins, caps, segment body are draw as seperate geometry, causing a visible overlap when using blending
- ✅ **2**: With a small angle and big enough width, two neighbouring segments begin to overlap
- ❌ **3**: When points are very close to eachother and line width is much bigger than the distance between the points - segments begin to overlap a lot
- ✅ **4**: When neighbouring points are placed at the same position - the line brakes due to zero vector length
- ❌ **5**: Side effect of the solution for the second corner case - unusual ovelapping between non neighbouring segments
- ✅ **6**: When neighbouring segments are parallel to each other, the division by zero happens causing the line to break
- ✅ **7**: As line gets wider, the UV coordinates shrink and the flips the sign
