//! Retained-mode handles and per-instance data.
//!
//! These types form the value side of the retained-mode API exposed by
//! [`crate::scene::Scene`]:
//!
//! - [`InstanceHandle`] — opaque, generational key for one live instance.
//!   Issued by `Scene::spawn`, invalidated by `Scene::despawn`.
//! - [`ObjectHandle`] — interned reference to an `Object` declared in the
//!   spec. Resolved once by `Scene::new`; stable for the lifetime of the
//!   scene's spec.
//! - [`StateHandle`] — interned reference to one named state within an
//!   object. Carries its parent [`ObjectHandle`] so cross-object mistakes
//!   are debug-detectable.
//! - [`Placement`] — anchor-specific position payload supplied at spawn
//!   time. The variant determines which rendering path applies to the
//!   instance; an explicit `move_to` is required to switch variants.
//! - [`Instance`] — the per-instance runtime state mutated by `Scene`
//!   methods. Exposed read-only via [`crate::scene::Scene::instance`] for
//!   game / debug queries.
