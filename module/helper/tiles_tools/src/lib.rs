//! This crate provides a comprehensive toolkit for working with tile-based maps,
//! with a special focus on hexagonal grids. It offers modules for handling various
//! coordinate systems, managing collections of tiles in grid structures, defining
//! layouts, handling geometric calculations, and performing pathfinding.
