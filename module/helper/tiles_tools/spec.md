**Part I: Public Contract (Mandatory Requirements)**

### 1. Project Goal
To create a high-performance, generic, and extensible Rust crate (`tiles_tools`) that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for developing tile-based games and applications. The engine will serve as a foundational layer, handling complex grid logic, pathfinding, and procedural generation, allowing developers to focus on game-specific rules and rendering.

### 2. Problem Solved
Game developers frequently reinvent the wheel for fundamental grid and tilemap mechanics. `tiles_tools` aims to solve this by providing a single, robust, and highly optimized library that offers a versatile data model, first-class support for grid duality, a performant ECS architecture, and powerful procedural generation and map analysis capabilities.

### 3. Ubiquitous Language (Vocabulary)
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Grid** | The abstract topological and geometric space on which the game exists. |
| **Primal Grid** | The primary grid structure, typically what the user sees as "tiles" (Faces, Edges, Vertices). |
| **Dual Grid** | A graph representation that is the dual of the `Primal Grid`, essential for representing relationships *between* tiles. |
| **Entity** | A unique identifier (ID) that represents a specific instance of a `Primitive` or a game object. |
| **Component** | A single piece of data associated with an `Entity` (e.g., `Position`, `PlayerID`). |
| **ECS** | Entity-Component-System, the core architectural pattern for the engine. |
| **WFC** | Wave Function Collapse, a powerful algorithm for procedural generation. |

### 4. Deliverables
1.  **Published Rust Crate:** The compiled `tiles_tools` library, published on `crates.io`.
2.  **Source Code Repository:** Full access to the version-controlled source code in a Git repository.
3.  **Comprehensive API Documentation:** `cargo doc` generated documentation, hosted publicly.
4.  **Usage Examples & Tutorials:** A collection of small projects demonstrating library usage.

### 5. Success Metrics
| Category | Metric | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adoption** | Downloads on `crates.io` | Achieve 1,000 downloads within 6 months of the 1.0 release. |
| **Usability** | Time to proficiency | A new developer can build the 'Procedural Island' example in under 2 hours. |
| **Community** | Engagement | Receive at least 10 non-trivial community contributions (issues, PRs) in the first year. |

**Part II: Internal Design (Design Recommendations)**

### 11. System Architecture
It is recommended that the crate be organized into loosely coupled modules (`ecs`, `grid`, `api`, `generation`, `analysis`, `manipulation`). An `api` module should serve as a public facade over the internal logic. It is highly recommended to use a mature, existing ECS library like `bevy_ecs` or `hecs`.

### 12. External Dependencies Analysis
The choice of a core ECS library is the most critical external dependency. The selection should be made after a careful trade-off analysis.

| Crate | Key Advantage | Potential Drawback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`bevy_ecs`** | Extremely performant, powerful query system, large community. | Can have slower compile times, larger dependency tree. |
| **`hecs`** | Very lightweight, fast compile times, simple API. | Fewer advanced features than `bevy_ecs`. |
| **`specs`** | The original major Rust ECS, very stable. | Less actively developed, architecture is older (less ergonomic). |

### 13. Core Algorithms
- **Pathfinding:** A* with Jump Point Search optimization.
- **Field of View:** Recursive Shadowcasting.
- **Procedural Generation:** Wave Function Collapse (WFC).
- **Flow Fields:** Dijkstra Maps.
- **Dungeon Generation:** Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) and Cellular Automata.
- **Branching Structures:** L-Systems.
- **Mesh Generation:** Greedy Meshing and support for Tile Blending.
