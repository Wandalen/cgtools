**Part I: Public Contract (The Rendering API)**

### 1. Project Goal
To create a high-performance, backend-agnostic 2D rendering engine for Rust, designed for maximum flexibility. The engine will decouple scene definition from the rendering implementation, allowing a single scene to be rendered across multiple backends.

### 2. Problem Solved
Developers are often locked into a single rendering backend, making it difficult to reuse rendering logic across different platforms or for different purposes. This project solves that by providing a clean abstraction layer, allowing a developer to define a scene once and render it anywhere.

### 3. Ubiquitous Language (Vocabulary)
| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Port** | An interface (a Rust `trait`) that defines a set of rendering capabilities. |
| **Adapter** | A concrete implementation of one or more `Port` traits for a specific `Backend`. |
| **Backend** | The underlying graphics library or technology used by an `Adapter`. |
| **Scene** | A description of everything to be rendered, composed of a `Command Queue`. |
| **Render Command** | A lightweight, POD `struct` that describes a single primitive to be drawn. |

### 4. Deliverables
1.  **Published Core Crate (`agnostic_renderer`):** The primary library with the public API and `Port` traits, with comprehensive feature gating for minimal dependencies.
2.  **Published Backend Adapter Crates:** Individual crates for each backend:
    - `renderer_adapter_svg` - Static SVG file generation
    - `renderer_adapter_svg_browser` - Interactive SVG with JavaScript
    - `renderer_adapter_webgl` - Hardware-accelerated WebGL rendering
    - `renderer_adapter_webgpu` - Next-generation WebGPU rendering
    - `renderer_adapter_terminal` - ASCII art terminal output
3.  **Integrated CLI Tool (`are`):** The interactive command-line tool built with `unilang`, included in the main crate via feature gating.
4.  **Source Code Repository:** A Git monorepo containing all crates with comprehensive feature flags.
5.  **Comprehensive API Documentation:** Publicly hosted `cargo doc` documentation.
6.  **Usage Examples & Gallery:** Examples showing the same scene rendered with different backends.
7.  **Feature Flag Documentation:** Complete guide for selecting minimal dependencies via cargo features.

### 5. Success Metrics
| Category | Metric | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adoption** | Downloads on `crates.io` | Achieve 500 downloads within 6 months of the 1.0 release. |
| **Extensibility** | Community Adapters | At least one community-contributed backend adapter within the first year. |
| **Usability** | Time to Proficiency | A new developer can create a basic 'hello world' adapter in under 4 hours. |

**Part II: Internal Design (Backend Implementation)**

### 11. System Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
It is strongly recommended to use a Ports and Adapters architecture. The `agnostic_renderer` crate contains the core logic and `Port` traits. Separate `Adapter` crates implement these traits using specific backend technologies, ensuring the core is decoupled from implementation details.

### 12. External Dependencies Analysis
The choice of libraries for backend adapters involves trade-offs.
- **SVG:** The `svg` crate is a strong candidate due to its builder pattern API, which maps well to the `RenderCommand` model.
- **Terminal:** `crossterm` is a good choice for its raw terminal manipulation capabilities, while `ratatui` could be used for more structured TUI output if needed. The simpler `crossterm` is likely sufficient.

### 13. Core Rendering Ports (Traits)
- A primary `Renderer` trait should define the rendering lifecycle (`begin_frame`, `render_scene`, `end_frame`).
- The `render_scene` method will dispatch commands to a `PrimitiveRenderer` trait.
- The `Renderer` trait should include methods for runtime capability discovery (e.g., `supports_textures()`).

### 14. Required Backend Adapters
The rendering engine must support multiple backend adapters to enable "write once, render anywhere" capability:

1.  **`renderer_adapter_svg`:** For generating static vector graphics files with perfect scalability.
2.  **`renderer_adapter_svg_browser`:** For interactive SVG rendering in web browsers with event handling.
3.  **`renderer_adapter_webgl`:** For hardware-accelerated web browser rendering via WebAssembly using `minwebgl`.
4.  **`renderer_adapter_webgpu`:** For next-generation GPU rendering in browsers and native apps using `minwebgpu`.
5.  **`renderer_adapter_terminal`:** For headless rendering and rapid prototyping in terminal environments.

### 15. Architectural & Flow Diagrams
*(Diagrams from Section 13 of the interactive session are considered part of the spec. Key diagrams include the C4 Container, Ports & Adapters Architecture, and Deployment Diagram.)*

**Part III: Project & Process Governance**

### 16. Core Principles of Development
1.  **Single Source of Truth:** The Git monorepo is absolute.
2.  **Documentation-First Development:** Spec changes are reviewed and merged before code.
3.  **Review-Driven Change Control:** All changes must go through a Pull Request.
4.  **Radical Transparency:** All decisions are captured in writing.
5.  **File Naming Conventions:** All files must use `snake_case`.

### 17. Open Questions
| ID | Question | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Q1** | Optimal strategy for backend-agnostic asset loading (fonts, textures). | Open |
| **Q2** | Optimal `unilang` syntax for complex, nested parameters. | Open |
| **Q3** | `wgpu` adapter window management strategy (create window vs. use raw handle). | Open |
